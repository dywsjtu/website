My name is Dongsheng Yang (杨东升). I am a second year Ph.D. student at Princeton University advised by Prof. Kai Li and Prof. Wyatt Lloyd. I recieved M.Sc. in Computer Science degree from Carnegie Mellon University in 2019, where I assisted in building the automatic DBMS tuning system OtterTune advised by Prof. Andy Pavlo. Before that, I got my B.Sc. in Computer Science degree (with SUMMA CUM LAUDE) from Peking University in 2018, where I worked with Prof. Tong Yang and led two projects on succinct data structures for data stream processing.
