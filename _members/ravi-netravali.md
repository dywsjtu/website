I am an Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department at Princeton University. My research interests are broadly in systems and networking, with a recent focus on improving large-scale machine learning (generative and predictive, cloud and edge) and video platforms in terms of performance, resource efficiency, affordability, and/or ease of use. My research has been recognized with a Sloan Research Fellowship, the SIGCOMM Rising Star Award, an NSF CAREER Award, multiple industry faculty research awards, and an IRTF Applied Networking Research Prize. Prior to joining Princeton, I was an Assistant Professor at UCLA from 2019-2021. Even earlier, I received a Ph.D. from MIT in 2018, and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University in 2012.
