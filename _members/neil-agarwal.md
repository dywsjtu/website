I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Princeton University. My research interests are at the intersection of systems, machine learning and networking. I am advised by Professor Ravi Netravali. Prior to Princeton, I spent the first 2 years of my PhD at UCLA. I did my bachelors at UC Berkeley, where I worked with Professors Scott Shenker and John Kubiatowicz on networks and IoT. I have also worked at Microsoft Research, Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sony Playstation.
