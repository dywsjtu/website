Hey there! I'm Tianle Cai (蔡天乐, pronounced Tyen-luh Tseye), a PhD candidate at Princeton under Professors Kai Li and Jason D. Lee. I completed my undergrad at Peking University in applied mathematics and computer science, guided by Professors Liwei Wang and Di He.

I was a part-time researcher at Together.ai working with Tri Dao. I've also worked at Google Deepmind with Xuezhi Wang and Denny Zhou, and at Microsoft Research with Sébastien Bubeck and Debadeepta Dey.

My research recently focuses on designing more efficient systems for large models with system-architecture co-design. I'm also broadly interested in network architecture design, representation learning, and optimization.

If you share common interests, are interested in potential collaboration, or simply want to connect for a chat, feel free to contact me. I'm always open to conversation :)
