I'm a 3rd-year CS Ph.D. student at Princeton University, advised by Prof. Ravi Netravali. I am broadly interested in the intersection of systems, networks, and machine learning. My recent work has focused on systems for efficient ML/LLM inference. I got my B.S. in CS and Math from University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I was fortunate to work with Prof. Shivaram Venkataraman on systems (cluster scheduling & resource allocation) for ML. I have also interned at AWS on systems for efficient LLM inference and at MPI-INF on networked systems for ML training.
