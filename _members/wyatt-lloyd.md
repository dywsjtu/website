I co-lead the S* Network Systems (SNS) group with Mike Freedman and Amit Levy in the CS department at Princeton. I also co-advise two students with Ethan Katz-Bassett in an initiative to specialize distributed systems and networking for large applications deployed in datacenters.

I am interested in the theory, design, implementation, evaluation, and deployment of large-scale distributed systems. Keywords like big data, storage, consistency, geo-replication, consensus, concurrency control, and fault tolerance pique my interest.
