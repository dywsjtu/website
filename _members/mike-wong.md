I am a fourth year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Princeton University where I work with Ravi Netravali. 
I am broadly interested in computer networks and systems. Recently, my work has involved improving the resource efficiency and performance of machine learning inference inference. 
I have also interned at Microsoft Research where I worked on anomaly detection in data center networks.
Prior to Princeton, I worked at the US Department of Defense in Fort Meade, MD. 
I received my bachelor's degree in computer science from New York University where I worked with Anirudh Sivaraman.
