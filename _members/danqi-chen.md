I am an assistant professor of Computer Science at Princeton University and I co-lead the Princeton NLP Group. I am also an associate director of Princeton Language and Intelligence, an initiative that seeks to develop fundamental research of large AI models (e.g., LLMs). Previously, I was a visiting scientist at Facebook AI Research (FAIR) in Seattle, working with Luke Zettlemoyer. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford University in 2018, where I was advised by Christopher Manning and worked in the Stanford NLP Group. Before that, I was an undergraduate student from the Special Pilot CS Class supervised by Andrew Yao at Tsinghua University.
